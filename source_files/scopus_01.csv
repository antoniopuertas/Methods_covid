Electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are broadly reviewed in terms of transduction elements, biorecognition elements, electrochemical techniques, and biosensor performance. Transduction elements are discussed in terms of electrode material and form factor. Biorecognition elements for pathogen detection, including antibodies, aptamers, and imprinted polymers, are discussed in terms of availability, production, and immobilization approach. Emerging areas of electrochemical biosensor design are reviewed, including electrode modification and transducer integration. Measurement formats for pathogen detection are classified in terms of sample preparation and secondary binding steps. Applications of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of pathogens in food and water safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and bio-threat applications are highlighted. Future directions and challenges of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are discussed, including wearable and conformal biosensors, detection of plant pathogens, multiplexed detection, reusable biosensors for process monitoring applications, and low-cost, disposable biosensors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-threat; Biosensors; COVID-19; Electrochemical; Food safety; Medical diagnostics; Pathogen quantification; Virus detection; Water safety","Bacteriophages; Biosensors; Chemical detection; Diagnosis; Pathogens; Process monitoring; Biorecognition elements; Disposable biosensor; Electrochemical biosensor; Electrochemical techniques; Electrode modification; Environmental Monitoring; Monitoring applications; Multiplexed detection; Electrochemical electrodes; carbohydrate binding protein; oligonucleotide; oligosaccharide; polymer; bacteriophage; chemical binding; chemical structure; classification; conductometry; cyclic voltammetry; electrochemistry; environmental monitoring; food safety; impedance spectroscopy; infection control; magnetic separation; methodology; microorganism detection; monitoring; nonhuman; phytopathogen; protozoon; Review; separation technique; signal transduction; thermodynamics; voltammetry","Johnson, B.N.121 Durham Hall (MC 0118), 1145 Perry Street, United States; email: bnj@vt.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09565663,,BBIOE,,"English","Biosens.

Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019-nCoV; clinical symptoms; coronavirus; meta-analysis; SARS-CoV-2","adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; case fatality rate; chronic disease; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; fever; hospital patient; human; incidence; meta analysis; muscle fatigue; muscle rigidity; myalgia; systematic review","Xi, J.; Department of Respiratory Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical UniversityChina; email: zbzbspf@163.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",01466615,,JMVID,"32108351","English","J.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Additional experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation. © 2020","COVID-19; Cytokines; Immunomodulation; Melatonin; Oxidation-reduction; SARS-CoV-2","melatonin; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; cytokine; immunological adjuvant; melatonin; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine production; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; epidemic; human; immune response; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; inflammation; oxidative stress; pandemic; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus attenuation; virus pathogenesis; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; inflammation; virology; virus pneumonia; Acute Lung Injury; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Immunomodulation; Inflammation; Melatonin; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","Liu, C.; Department of Vascular Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 1, Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, China; email: liucw@vip.sina.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",00243205,,LIFSA,"32217117","English","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082653958

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available.

The number of cases worldwide is increasing exponentially and poses a major health threat, especially for those who are elderly, immuno-compromised, or have comorbidities. This also applies to AD patients on systemic immune-modulating treatment. In these days of uncertainty, reallocation of medical resources, curfew, hoarding, and shutdown of normal social life, patients, caregivers and doctors ask questions regarding the continuation of systemic immune-modulating treatment of AD patients. The ETFAD decided to address some of these questions here. This article is protected by copyright.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the spread of the virus to be a global pandemic. Currently, there are over 1 million cases and over 100,000 confirmed deaths due to the virus. Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0–1 Å. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected. This new methodology of epitope-based vaccine prediction is fundamental and fast in application, ad can be economically beneficial and viable. © 2020","Epitope; HLA-Alleles; Immuno-informatics; SARS-COV-2; Simulation; Vaccine",,"Kaushik, V.; Domain of Bioinformatics, School of Bio-Engineering and Bio-Sciences, Lovely Professional UniversityIndia; email: vikas.14664@lpu.co.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",23529148,,,,"English","Inform.

At that time, almost nobody paid any attention to it. The new pathogen, however, fast proved to be extremely infectious and dangerous, resulting in about 3-5% mortality. Over the few months that followed, coronavirus has spread over entire world. At the end of March, the total number of infections is fast approaching the psychological threshold of one million, resulting so far in tens of thousands of deaths. Due to the high number of lives already lost and the virus high potential for further spread, and due to its huge overall impact on the economies and societies, it is widely admitted that coronavirus poses the biggest challenge to the humanity after the second World war. The COVID-19 epidemic is provoking numerous questions at all levels. It also shows that modern society is extremely vulnerable and unprepared to such events. A wide scientific and public discussion becomes urgent. Some possible directions of this discussion are suggested in this article. © The authors.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).
